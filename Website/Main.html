            PixelPlay is a game system that uses a microcontroller, five LEDs, and five buttons to allow for four different game modes. 
            Each mode has its own set of challenges, such as, testing and improving memory, reaction time, and coordination. 
            You start in what is know as "the Lobby" until you press one of the buttons.
            Anyone can create and play PixelPlay by putting together the hardware and uploading the code to your microcontroller.

            The Reaction Game is the first game mode of PixelPlay. 
            It is played by pressing the button corresponding to the green LED in the lobby. 
            The goal is to press the corresponding button when one of the five LEDs lights up randomly. After the player presses the button correctly for fifteen LEDs in a row, the next round starts, and the time limit is reduced. 
            If the player fails to press the button in time, they are returned to the lobby, and their round is displayed.

            The Memory Game is the second game mode of PixelPlay.
            It is played by pressing the button corresponding to the purple LED in the lobby.
            The goal is to memorize a sequence of random LEDs, with the number of LEDs in the sequence increasing with each round. Each time the player correctly repeats the sequence, 
            they move on to the next round, where the sequence stays the same, but one additional random LED is added to the end.

            The Reaction and Memory Game is the third game mode of PixelPlay.
            It is played by pressing the button corresponding to the blue LED in the lobby.
            It works by presenting the player with a sequence of four, six, or eight LEDs, depending on the round. 
            The player must then repeat the sequence in time to move on to the next round, with the time limit decreasing each round.
        </p>

            Whack-A-Mole is the fourth game mode of PixelPlay. It is played by pressing the button corresponding to the red LED in the lobby. 
            The goal is to press the button when one of the five LEDs lights up randomly. 
            The time limit is thirty seconds, and the objective is to press as many buttons corresponding to the LEDs as possible within the allotted time.
